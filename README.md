Project 4: REST API Server with Node.js and Express
This project builds a Node.js server that provides a REST API for accessing and modifying static question/answer data. It uses Express for routing and supports different HTTP verbs like GET, and optionally POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Key Features
Serves question and answer data using Express routes
Code split into modules for clean organization
GET routes for retrieving single or all questions/answers
I even got some extra credit: POST, PUT, and DELETE support
Tested endpoints using Postman
